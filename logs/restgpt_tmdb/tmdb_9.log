Caller: I need to call the API with the GET method on the /person/525/movie_credits endpoint. I will replace the {person_id} placeholder with the id of Christopher Nolan which is 525. The API will return a list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan. The instruction also mentions filtering the results by director and sorting them by release date in descending order. However, these are not parameters that can be sent in the API call. Therefore, I will assume that the filtering and sorting will be done after we get the response.

Operation: GET
Input: {
    "url": "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/525/movie_credits",
    "description": "The API response contains the list of movies directed by Christopher Nolan.",
    "output_instructions": "Extract the names and ids of the movies directed by Christopher Nolan from the response. Filter the results by director and sort them by release date in descending order."
