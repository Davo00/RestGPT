Code: 
Based on the given API response schema, there seems to be no field that directly provides the director's name. Therefore, it won't be possible to extract the director's name from the API response using Python.

If the API response contained a 'director' field, or a 'crew' field with a job type 'Director', we could write code to extract the director's name. But as per the provided API response schema, this is not possible.

If the schema is updated to include the director's name or a relevant field, then the Python code could be written accordingly.

The API's response JSON schema does not include a field for the director's name, thus it is not possible to write Python code to extract this information from the given response.

Caller: Thought: I cannot finish executing the plan without knowing some other information. The API response does not include the director's information of the movie "The Shawshank Redemption".
