API Selector: GET /person/1769/movie_credits to get the list of movies directed by Sofia Coppola (id 1769)
HTTP Request: POST https://api.ai.internalprod.eu-central-1.aws.ml.hana.ondemand.com/v2/inference/deployments/d9874e217c1c07d8/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Caller: Given the provided id of Sofia Coppola, I need to make a GET request to the "/person/{person_id}/movie_credits" endpoint of the The Movie Database API. This will give me the movie credits for Sofia Coppola.

Operation: GET
Input: {
    "url": "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/1769/movie_credits",
    "description": "The API response is the movie credit list of Sofia Coppola (id 1769)",
    "output_instructions": "What are the names and ids of the movies directed by Sofia Coppola?"
}

Assuming the API call is successful, the response should contain a list of movie credits for Sofia Coppola. I will extract the names and ids of the movies directed by Sofia Coppola from the response. 

If the API call fails, I will provide a reason for the failure based on the error message returned by the API.
