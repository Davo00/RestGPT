Code: 
Here is the Python code to extract the required information from the API response:

```python
# Assuming the JSON response is stored in a dictionary variable 'data'
logos = data['logos']

for logo in logos:
    file_path = logo['file_path']
    width = logo['width']
    height = logo['height']
    file_type = logo['file_type']

    # Check if file type is SVG
    is_svg = "Yes" if file_type == ".svg" else "No"

    print(f"File Path: {file_path}, Width: {width}, Height: {height}, File Type: {file_type}, Is SVG: {is_svg}")
```

This code will iterate over all the logos in the API response and print the file path, width, height, and file type of each one. It will also print whether or not each logo is an SVG.
