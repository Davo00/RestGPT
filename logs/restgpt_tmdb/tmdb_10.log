Code: 
Here is the Python code to extract the names and IDs of the movies directed by the person:

```python
# Assuming the JSON response is stored in a variable 'data'
crew_data = data.get('crew', [])

for item in crew_data:
    if item.get("job").lower() == "director":
        print("The name of the movie is {0} and the id is {1}".format(item.get("title"), item.get("id")))
```

This code will print out lines in the format "The name of the movie is {movie_name} and the id is {id}" for each movie directed by the person.

Parser: The API response does not provide information on the movies directed by the person. The response contains movie credits of the person, where they appear as a cast member. Therefore, the names and ids of the movies directed by this person cannot be extracted from the provided API response.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.ai.internalprod.eu-central-1.aws.ml.hana.ondemand.com/v2/inference/deployments/d9874e217c1c07d8/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Caller: Thought: I cannot finish executing the plan without knowing some other information. The API response does not contain the information needed to complete the plan. 

Execution Result: The plan to get the list of movies directed by Martin Scorsese was not successful as the API response from GET /person/1032/movie_credits does not contain the necessary information about the movies directed by him.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.ai.internalprod.eu-central-1.aws.ml.hana.ondemand.com/v2/inference/deployments/d9874e217c1c07d8/chat/completions?api-version=2023-09-01-preview "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

Caller: Since I have the id for Martin Scorsese from the background, I can substitute it into the API endpoint to fetch the movie credits for this specific person. Since the plan specifies the need to sort the movies by rating, I will include this as a parameter in the GET request.
Operation: GET
Input: 
{
    "url": "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/1032/movie_credits",
    "description": "The API response contains the movie credit list of Martin Scorsese (id 1032).",
    "output_instructions": "Extract the names and ids of the movies directed by Martin Scorsese and sort them by rating. Return this sorted list of movie names and ids."
}
If I get a successful response from this API call, I will extract the movie names and ids from the response, and sort them by rating as instructed in the plan. If I run into any issues, I will describe them in my response.
